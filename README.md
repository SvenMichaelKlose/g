This is about to become a boot and file manager for the
Ultimem memory expander for the Commodore VIC-20, featuring
a journaling a Flash ROM file system, called "UltiFS".

# TODO

* Make an assembly version of ultifs.c.
* Hook UltiFS into the KERNAL. I/O area could be a nice
  place for it.
* Make the file manager a regular (non-cc65g) app.
