V-Forth defines words that provide access to a number of KERNAL
subroutines. In addition words are defined that provide efficient ways
of invoking multiple KERNAL subroutine calls.

Many of the words return serr, a combination of the KERNAL return
value and appropriate flags

        15  14-8   7-0
	--------------
        Cb   .A   STATUS/
                  RSSTAT

where Cb and .A are the carry bit and accumulator after the KERNAL
call and the bottom 8 bits are the contents of RSSTAT (if the last
call was to the RS-232 device) or STATUS flags.


$PLOT   ( x y -- )

Set screen co-ordinates to given row and column.

$SETNAM   ( addr count -- )

Set file name for later KERNAL calls.

$SETLFS   ( sa da lfn -- )

Set logical file number, device address and secondary address for
later KERNAL calls.

$READST   ( -- st )

Returns value of the STATUS or RSSTAT flags.

$OPEN   ( -- serr )

Opens a logical file specified by parameters given in prior calls to
$SETNAM and $SETLFS.

$CLOSE   ( lfn -- serr )

Close a logical file.

$CHKOUT   ( lfs -- da serr )

Set the output channel to a logical file, returns the error state and
the device of the previous output channel.

$RSTOUT   ( da -- )

Restore the output channel to a previous device.

$WRITEB   ( 8b -- serr )

Send a byte to the output channel using the CHROUT subroutine.

$WRITE   ( addr count -- serr )

Send a block of count bytes to the output channel.

$CHKIN   ( lfn -- da serr )

Set the input channel to a logical file, returns the error state and
the device of the previous input channel.

$RSTIN   ( da -- )

Restore the input channel to a previous device.

$READ   (addr count1 -- count2 serr )

Receive a block of up to count1 bytes from the input channel. Returns
the number of bytes read.

$READLINE   (addr count -- serr )

Receive up to count bytes into memory starting at addr, or until a CR
is read. The length read is stored in addr, the CR is not included in
the length.

$CLRCHN   ( -- )

Reset both input and output channels to the defaults.

$SAVE   ( start end -- serr )

Save a region of memory between start and end-1 to the file name and
device given in prior calls to $SETNAM and $SETLFS.

$LOAD   ( start -- end serr )

Load a region of memory from the file name and device given in prior
calls to $SETNAM and $SETLFS. If the secondary address is zero the
file is loaded to start, otherwise the start address is defined by the
contents of the file.
